# Introduction

- Introduction to WASM

    > WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

    - Efficient and fast
    - Safe
    - Open and debuggable
    - Part of the open web platform

    And yes, WebAssembly 1.0 has shipped in 4 major browser engines!
